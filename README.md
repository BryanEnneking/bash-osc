# Bash OSC
Bash OSC is a basic implementation of the Open Sound Control protocol over UDP written as a Bash script.  The goal is to provide a simple and performant utility that is not necessarily full-featured (e.g. bundles are not supported).  It can be used either as a sourced library or as a stand-alone command-line utility.  Care has been taken to minimize dependencies and external calls for both portability as well as performance reasons.  Bash OSC is open-source and free to use and modify
